# Introduction to Web Servers

A **web server** is software that serves content (like web pages) over the internet to users who request it. When you enter a website address in your browser, your browser sends a request to a web server, which returns the website's content.

### Popular Web Servers:
- **Apache**: One of the most widely used web servers in the world.
- **Nginx**: Known for high performance and stability.

In this tutorial, we will focus on setting up the Apache web server on a Linux-based system, specifically Ubuntu.
